# Liri-node-app

This is a command line application using Node JS. It will generate specific data sets regarding songs, concerts, and movies based upon the users input. The three commands the user has are:
    
    * spotify-this-song
    * concert-this
    * movie-this
    * do-what-it-says

After the user types in the command, they can enter in whatever song, concert, or movie they would like to see information about. If no value is given after the command the application will produce a default data set generated by the random.txt file.
